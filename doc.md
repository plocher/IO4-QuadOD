## Description

This project is a simple baseboard for current sensing detectors.
It was inspired (in reverse chronological order) by railnerd, MarkS, MRCS, RR-Cirkits and, of course, Dr Bruce Chubb.


The Quad-OD  board has 4x connectors that can be populated with either MRCS cpOD or CMRI DCCOD occupancy detector cards.  The board can be powered locally (with a +5vDC wall wart) or remotely (by a "IO4 Field Unit" I/O card), and provides 4x open drain "pull to ground when detected" occupancy feedback lines.

The IO4-QuadOD is a multi-purpose board - it supports 3 different use cases:
1. It can be an IO4 peripheral using the SPCoast 6-pin RJ12 connector scheme,
2. It can be hardwired using screw terminals and/or a 5VDC wallwart, or
3. With the addition of a WemosD1Mini 8266 MCU board, it can become a distributed WiFi and/or I2C peripheral. (Software not provided...)

THere were several previous versions:
  * Rev 1.0 was a conceptual effort to build a self contained unit (like the [[IO4-Detector]], but with DCC-OD design instead of a Paisley one) but the complexity and inflexability doomed it...
  * Rev 2.0A simplified things to simply use DCC-OD style cards AS-IS.  Unfortunately, the card-to-card spacing was a bit too tight, and 4x cards wouldn't fit without severely distorting the PCB.
  * Rev 2.0B is the same design as 2.0A, but with fixed spacing.


The 2x IO4 connections are arranged so that two adjacent control
points can both monitor a shared set of detected blocks (usually
used by approach logic...).  One (master) provides a power source,
the other (slave) does not; all other signals from the IO4 connector
are in common.  This implies that both need to be connected to INPUT
configured ports.
